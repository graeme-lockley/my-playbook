# Tooling

This is a listing off all the tools that I use covering all the topics that really matter:

- Purpose
- Installation across environment.  Typically these environments are:
  - My Mac
  - Inside a devcontainer running on my developer workstation
  - Azure using Azure Dev Ops
  - Azure using a github Action
- How-to
- References

As far as possible the intent of these pages is not to communicate what is already available via reference manuals and blogs but rather what I do.
