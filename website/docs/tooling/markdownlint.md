# markdownlint

[markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) is a CLI onto [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint).

The [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language is designed to be easy to read, write, and understand. It succeeds - and its flexibility is both a benefit and a drawback. Many styles are possible, so formatting can be inconsistent. Some constructs don't work well in all parsers and should be avoided. The [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org) specification standardizes parsers - but not authors.

markdownlint is a static analysis tool for Node.js with a library of rules to enforce standards and consistency for Markdown files. It was inspired by - and heavily influenced by - Mark Harrison's [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) for Ruby. The initial rules, rule documentation, and test cases came directly from that project.
