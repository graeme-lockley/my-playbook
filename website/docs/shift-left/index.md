# Continuous Shift Left

The principle of shift left is to take tasks and perform them as early as possible in the engineering process. Often this involves breaking tasks down into smaller atomic activities so that they can be spread throughout the process rather than seeing them as a single activity performed in the later phases of the process.

*Continuous Shift Left* advances the shift left principle further by requiring:

- Each of the shift left tasks are automated,
- Each of the shift left tasks are stored and versioned with the code base of the application under consideration,
- Each of the shift left tasks are executed on every change, and
- If a single shift left task fails then that version of the code base is considered broken

The *Continuous Shift Left* tasks are divided into the following groupings.
