# Engineering Playbook

This site captures my engineering playbook.  Why have a playbook?  The truth is I am involved in a great many things and, when considering the elapse of time, what I know today and have grooved into muscle memory, is gone within a month.  So I find it useful to write things down.

This site is therefore an attempt to create a more structured way of writing things down and, by virtue of it being public, perhaps others might find value.

Often we look at repos and, like an archeologist, attempt to reconstruct the thinking that drove the repo in a particular direction.
